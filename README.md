##### 1. Data Analyses
##### This section can be further split into 5 parts:
- ##### Data Loading
  ##### Data loading is basically a method which required to load the current original dataset into a data that we can work around inside the coding applications. As I am currently using Python, I used one of the modules, Pandas, to load the dataset. Below is some method that I used :-
  - ##### pandas.read_csv() = Read a csv file format and directly convert into a dataframe (a table consist of columns and row)

- ##### Data Inspection
  ##### Next is a data inspection in which the dataframe loaded will be inspect. The function of this steps is to check for any abnormalities exist in the data such missing values, duplicates and etcetra. The data inspection also use the same Pandas module under DataFrame methods, which are :- 
    - ##### .info() = Display the datatype of values exist in each column
    - ##### .head() = Display the first five row of the dataframe
    - ##### .describe() = Summary of the dataframe (median,mean,etc)
   
- ##### Data Cleaning
- ##### Feature Selection
- ##### Data Preprocessing
